# Hands-On Python Fundamentals 

A curated collection of hands-on challenges and mini-projects designed to build and reinforce your understanding of core **Python programming concepts** â€” from data structures to logic and real-world simulation tasks.

Each challenge includes:
-  A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with task instructions and guidance
-  A standalone Python file (`.py`) containing the full code solution
